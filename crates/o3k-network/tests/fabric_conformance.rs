//! O3K-side gate for the shared fabric provider contract.
//!
//! The `fabric-conformance` crate ships one executable suite that runs
//! against the reference in-memory fake kernel (`fabric_linux::RecordingRunner`).
//! Running it here as an integration test keeps the O3K build pinned to a
//! `fabric` provider revision that satisfies the fabric provider contract
//! (`contracts/fabric-provider-v1.md` in the o3kio/fabric repository), so a
//! future provider bump that breaks the contract fails O3K CI instead of
//! surfacing on hosts.
//!
//! Per ADR-0186 and SPEC-0049's provider conformance requirements, this is
//! the unprivileged provider-level gate; the privileged multi-host gate is
//! a separate harness in the fabric repository, and the real functional
//! gate (three independent KVM/libvirt hosts) remains SPEC-0049's
//! promotion requirement.
//!
//! Phase 1 of the shared-provider migration: this test pins the tag on
//! O3K's toolchain before any production code depends on it. The
//! `linux_fabric` migration onto `LinuxFabricProvider` follows in bounded
//! phases; until then this gate proves the pinned revision continuously.
